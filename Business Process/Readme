Phase II 
focuses on modeling the business processes relevant to the Mine Safety Violation Monitoring System (MSVMS).
It involves defining the process scope, identifying key actors, and mapping all activities using BPMN 2.0 
swimlanes to show responsibilities and workflow interactions. 
The model captures the entire lifecycle of a safety violation—from detection and reporting, through automated system actions, inspections, remediation, verification, and final closure.
Proper BPMN notation is applied to represent events, tasks, gateways, and system flows, ensuring a logical, structured, and MIS-aligned representation.
This phase produces a complete process diagram and a short documentation explaining objectives, actors, system roles, organizational impact, and opportunities for analytics.
