                            🛡️ Mine Safety Violation Monitoring System (MSVMS)

The Mine Safety Violation Monitoring System (MSVMS) is an intelligent PL/SQL-based solution designed to enhance safety management within mining operations.
It continuously monitors safety violations, analyzes risk levels, triggers automatic alerts, and generates comprehensive reports for supervisors and decision-makers.

🌍 The mining industry remains one of the most hazardous sectors worldwide.
MSVMS provides a practical digital solution to strengthen prevention and reduce accidents.

🚀 Project Objectives

  . 🗄️ Build a complete database system to manage mine sites, employees, inspections, and safety violations.

  . 🤖 Automate the detection and classification of incidents using PL/SQL.

  . 🔔 Trigger automatic alerts when severe violations occur.

  . 📊 Produce periodic analytical reports for management decision-making.

  . 🛑 Promote a sustainable safety culture and reduce workplace hazards.

 🧱 Database Architecture

The MSVMS database is built around five main tables, structured to ensure efficient tracking and analysis:
| Table              | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **MINE_SITE**      | Stores mine site information (name, location, supervisor)    |
| **EMPLOYEE**       | Contains employee details and site assignments               |
| **VIOLATION**      | Records safety violations, severity, dates, and descriptions |
| **INSPECTION**     | Logs inspection history and inspectors’ remarks              |
| **RECOMMENDATION** | Stores corrective actions proposed for each violation        |

🔗 Key Relationships

   . A mine site can have multiple employees and inspections.

   . An employee may commit multiple violations.

   . Each violation can generate one or more corrective recommendations.
